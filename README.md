# IB RUST API

> **An Interactive Brokers API for Rust**

## About
I created this library for my own personal automated trading system written in Rust.

I also want to give an honorable mention to the follow project that helped me figure out some of the low level communications.

## ToDo
 - Use the ``any`` trait for api parameters to avoid specific methods for each datatype
 - Publish to crates.io
